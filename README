Still under HEAVY development.
I would recommend you use http://cbcjava.googlecode.com/issues/attachment?aid=-4010490748107432490&name=CBCJavaInstaller.tar.gz for now
At this point, much of the stuff in this repo is untested, and subject to lots of changes

Stick around though, we should have a stable version soon!
